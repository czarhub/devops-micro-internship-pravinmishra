# Assignment 2 — CodeTrack: Tracking, Staging, Committing + Deploy to EC2

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will track and stage project files, create two meaningful Git commits in `CodeTrack`, verify your commit history, and deploy the CodeTrack static website to an EC2 instance using Nginx. This connects local version-control practice with a basic manual deployment workflow used in real DevOps environments.

# Task 1 — Verify Git Setup and Enter the Repository

## Goal

Confirm that Git works and that you are inside the correct `CodeTrack` repository.

### Evidence
